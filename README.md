#### INTERACTIVE QUIZ APPLICATION

This is a simple Interactive Quiz Application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application dynamically generates quiz questions and provides instant feedback on answers.

### FEATURES

- Dynamically loads quiz questions and answer options
- Provides real-time feedback on selected answers
- Keeps track of the total score
- Includes a "Next Question" button to navigate through questions
- Displays the final score at the end
- Styled using CSS for a clean and interactive user experience

### HOW IT WORKS

1. The application displays one question at a time with multiple-choice options.
2. Users select an answer, and immediate feedback is shown (Correct/Incorrect).
3. The Next Question button appears after answering.
4. Once all questions are answered, the final score is displayed.
